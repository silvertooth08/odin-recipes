In this project I started with an index page and then i linked recipe pages to index page.
After that,I started to build the index page and continued to build recipe pages one at a time
In the end I faced some problems that made fried calamari page doesn't function properly and I fixed the issue with changing the image.
After that I did some small changes for typos and size of the index page image.

In this project I used headings,paragraphs,adding images via static links,adding pages via relative links, using ordered and unordered lists, 
building the html boiler plate and using git commands to mark my edits and see the progress.
